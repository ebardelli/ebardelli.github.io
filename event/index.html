Less is known, though, about the specific features of preparation that explain program variation in outcomes. We explore how specific TPP features correlate with graduates’ initial performance and improvement during their early careers. We use program completer data from one state and link it to teacher evaluation data and USDoE Title 2 data. We find variation in both initial performance and improvement along different TPP features, including areas of endorsement, program type, clinical placement type and length, program size and faculty composition.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/mentoring-panel/>Replicating and Extending the Mentors Matter Recruitment Initiative Findings</a></h2><div class=article-style>Emerging research in teacher education is showing that cooperating teachers (CTs) have a substantial impact on preservice student teachers’ (PSTs’) future teaching trajectories. In large-scale observational studies of recent graduates in Tennessee and Washington state (Goldhaber, Krieg, & Theobald, 2020; Ronfeldt, Brockman, & Campbell, 2018), researchers found that PSTs who were placed with more instructionally effective CTs were more instructionally effective themselves.The correlational nature of these studies, though, raised questions about whether these relationships were truly causal or just spurious correlations due to outside factors.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/appam20/>Effects of using administrative data to guide the recruitment of instructionally effective & experienced clinical mentors: Results from a randomized control trial</a></h2><div class=article-style>In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete clinical training, often referred to as “student teaching” or “residency,” in the classroom of a clinical mentor (CM) – a P-12 teacher who mentors them as they take on classroom teaching responsibilities. There is increasing evidence that clinical training generally, and CMs specifically, have important influences on preservice student teacher (PST) development. Three new studies show that teacher candidates who were mentored by instructionally effective teachers are more instructionally effective themselves once employed, suggesting that teacher education programs and district/school leaders should recruit more instructionally effective teachers to serve as CMs.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/early-career-ciers/>Early Career Supports and their Relation to Teacher Effectiveness and Employment Outcomes</a></h2><div class=article-style>Link to talk</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/mmr-ciers/>Mentors matter recruitment: Results from a field experiment within a teacher preparation program</a></h2><div class=article-style>In this talk, I will discuss the results of the mentors matter recruitment initiative—a field experiment within a teacher preparation program that had the goal of improving student teacher experiences by recruiting mentor teachers using evaluation data.

I will also discuss preliminary results from a replication study and plans for an upcoming scale-up study.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/recruitment-rct/>Effects of using administrative data to guide the recruitment of instructionally effective and experienced cooperating teachers: Results from a randomized control trial</a></h2><div class=article-style>This talk has been cancelled
In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete clinical training, often referred to as “student teaching” or “residency,” in the classroom of a cooperating teacher (CT) – a P-12 teacher who mentors them as they take on classroom teaching responsibilities. There is increasing evidence that clinical training generally, and CTs specifically, have important influences on preservice student teacher (PST) development. New research shows that teacher candidates who were mentored by instructionally effective teachers are more instructionally effective themselves once employed, suggesting that teacher education programs and district/school leaders should recruit more instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs (Authors, 2018a; Authors 2018b; Goldhaber et al.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/mkt-growth/>Who benefits from mathematics courses for teachers? An analysis of MKT-G growth during geometry for teachers courses</a></h2><div class=article-style>This talk has been cancelled
While mathematics content courses are expected to provide future teachers with the needed content knowledge to become an effective educator, little is known about the effects of these courses on content knowledge development. In this paper, we report on the outcomes for 222 students from 13 Geometry for Teachers courses taken across the United States. We find that completing this course is positively associated with a growth in MKT-G scores similar to the growth in MKT-G scores that we would expect between the first and second year of experience teaching geometry.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/event/mmr/>Mentors Matter Recruitment initiative: Can mentor teacher recruitment increase student teacher feelings of preparedness?</a></h2><div class=article-style>In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete clinical training, often referred to as “student teaching” or “residency,” in the classroom of a cooperating teacher (CT) – a P-12 teacher who mentors them as they take on classroom teaching responsibilities.
