initiative—a field experiment within a teacher preparation program that had the
goal of improving student teacher experiences by recruiting mentor teachers
using evaluation data. Our results show that our experiment increased the
average mentor teachers' evaluation scores and improved student teachers’
feelings of preparedness at the end of their student teaching placement. I will
also discuss preliminary results from a replication study and plans for an
upcoming scale-up study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete
clinical training, often referred to as “student teaching” or “residency,” in
the classroom of a cooperating teacher (CT) – a P-12 teacher who mentors them
as they take on classroom teaching responsibilities. There is increasing
evidence that clinical training generally, and CTs specifically, have
important influences on preservice student teacher (PST) development. New
research shows that teacher candidates who were mentored by instructionally
effective teachers are more instructionally effective themselves once
employed, suggesting that teacher education programs and district/school
leaders should recruit more instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs
(Authors, 2018a; Authors 2018b; Goldhaber et al., 2018). However, program
leaders report that it is often difficult to recruit instructionally effective
teachers to serve as mentors for a variety of reasons, including: (1) school
and district leaders may be resistant to hand responsibility of instruction to
novice teachers in the classrooms of their strongest teachers, (2) school,
district and program leaders may not know who their most instructionally
effective teachers are, and (3) these different stakeholders may have
competing criteria for selecting mentors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this initiative, we used prior information on instructional performance and
years of experience (from administrative data) to identify the most
instructionally effective and experienced potential CTs in the specific
districts, subjects and grade levels needed by a large program that partnered
with us. Our state partners, with our technical support, then randomly
assigned neighboring districts to receive these targeted recruitment lists (or
not) and requested district leaders who received the lists to begin their
recruitment with teachers named on the lists; district leaders were also
advised to use their best judgement where they felt it inappropriate or unwise
for any listed teachers to serve. We investigate whether receiving these lists
(1) increases the instructional quality of the CTs that are actually recruited
and (2) improves feelings of preparedness, based upon data collected from
online surveys completed by PSTs at the end of their clinical training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We find that CTs in treatment districts have, on average, substantially higher
evaluation scores than CTs in control districts. These differences are
significant on observation ratings (0.332 s.d. units), TVAAS scores (0.654
s.d. units), and years of experience (0.558 s.d. units). Furthermore, at the
end of clinical training, PSTs in treatment districts reported feeling
significantly better prepared on both questioning practices (0.660 standard
deviation units) and other instructional skills (0.576 standard deviation
units). On the other hand, PSTs in treatment and control districts reported
statistically similar rates of mentoring and coaching activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These results suggest that the recruitment of CTs is a feasible and effective
lever to improve teacher education. As our intervention uses evaluation and
personnel data that is readily available at the district and state level,
using prior information to aid the recruitment of CTs is a low-cost
intervention that can significantly impact the overall instructional quality
of CTs, as well as their PSTs’ readiness to teach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who benefits from mathematics courses for teachers? An analysis of MKT-G growth during geometry for teachers courses</title><link>//bardelli.me/talk/mkt-growth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>//bardelli.me/talk/mkt-growth/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.aera.net/Newsroom/AERA-Announces-2020-Annual-Meeting-Change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This talk has been cancelled&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While mathematics content courses are expected to provide future teachers with
the needed content knowledge to become an effective educator, little is known
about the effects of these courses on content knowledge development. In this
paper, we report on the outcomes for 222 students from 13 Geometry for
Teachers courses taken across the United States. We find that completing this
course is positively associated with a growth in MKT-G scores similar to the
growth in MKT-G scores that we would expect between the first and second year
of experience teaching geometry. We also observe that these positive results
are concentrated with course completers who are interested in pursuing a
secondary mathematics teacher certification.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mentors Matter Recruitment initiative: Can mentor teacher recruitment increase student teacher feelings of preparedness?</title><link>//bardelli.me/talk/mmr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>//bardelli.me/talk/mmr/</guid><description>&lt;p>In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete
