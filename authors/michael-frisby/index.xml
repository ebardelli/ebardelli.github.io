Differential Effects of Non-binding Placement Recommendations on Students' Course-taking Decisions</title><link>/talk/math-placement-aera22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>/talk/math-placement-aera22/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mathematics course placement procedures have received significant scholarly attention in recent years. However, this research largely focuses on placement into community college development education coursework in a context where course recommendations are binding. In contrast, this paper examines non-binding mathematics placement procedures at a large flagship four-year university. We use support vector machines and a regression discontinuity design to study the causal effect of following mathematics placement recommendations on both short- and long-term outcomes. Our results show significant heterogeneity along gender and racial identities for which students follow their recommendation. Moreover, the decision to take calculus could potentially have negative effects on students’ outcomes. Our results offer insight for student placement policies at four-year universities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development of the Short Critical Consciousness Scale (ShoCCS)</title><link>/publication/diemer-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/diemer-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>Critical consciousness represents the analysis and critique of structural inequalities, the motivation and perceived capacity to effect change, and social action to redress inequity. A wave of recent instruments measuring critical consciousness has been rigorously validated. Yet, whether these measures efficiently assess different levels of critical consciousness or contain redundant, or non-informative, items remain unknown. This research develops a short version (Short CCS, or ShoCCS) of the previously validated Critical Consciousness Scale. Using Item Response Theory methods, the long-form CCS is scrutinized for redundant items to efficiently measure critical reflection, critical motivation, and critical action. The resulting 13-item ShoCCS yields an internally consistent instrument with similar information distributions as the longer measure. Since the ShoCCS places less financial and time burden on investigators and respondents in comparison to the original CCS, and includes a new measure of critical motivation, it may streamline CC measurement in scholarship, practice, and policy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
