&lt;p>While mathematics content courses are expected to provide future teachers with
the needed content knowledge to become an effective educator, little is known
about the effects of these courses on content knowledge development. In this
paper, we report on the outcomes for 222 students from 13 Geometry for
Teachers courses taken across the United States. We find that completing this
course is positively associated with a growth in MKT-G scores similar to the
growth in MKT-G scores that we would expect between the first and second year
of experience teaching geometry. We also observe that these positive results
are concentrated with course completers who are interested in pursuing a
secondary mathematics teacher certification.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The role of emotions in simulations of practice</title><link>/talk/teacher-emotions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 14:10:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/talk/teacher-emotions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Framing a task as both construction and proof: How do teachers manage?</title><link>/talk/framing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 10:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/talk/framing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Teacher decision making in instructional situations in algebra and geometry: Do teachers follow instructional norms?</title><link>/talk/teacher-decisions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2018 16:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/talk/teacher-decisions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Learning about the norms of teaching practice: How can machine learning help analyze teachers’ reactions to scenarios?</title><link>/talk/ml-appraisal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/talk/ml-appraisal/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.soe.umich.edu/news_events/news/article/emanuele_bardelli_and_michael_ions_project_awarded_most_likely_transformati/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News release&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using virtual spaces to promote teacher professional growth: Acting to believing</title><link>/talk/virtual-pd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 10:30:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>/talk/virtual-pd/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Role of Simulations for Supporting Professional Growth: Teachers’ Engagement in Virtual Professional Experimentation</title><link>/publication/milewski-2018-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/milewski-2018-a/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
