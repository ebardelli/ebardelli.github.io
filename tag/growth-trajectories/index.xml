workforce outcomes. Less is known, though, about the specific features of preparation that
explain program variation in outcomes. We explore how specific TPP features correlate with
graduates’ initial performance and improvement during their early careers. We use program
completer data from one state and link it to teacher evaluation data and USDoE Title 2 data. We
find variation in both initial performance and improvement along different TPP features,
including areas of endorsement, program type, clinical placement type and length, program size
and faculty composition. Our results have the potential to inform how TPP features relate to
graduates’ outcomes and levers for TPP improvement.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
