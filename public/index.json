Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit HNA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee, we observe that the number of teachers who receive HNA endorsements has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNA teachers have similar student achievement gains as non-HNA teachers. Though HNA and non-HNA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM and special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Overall, findings suggest that efforts in Tennessee to recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with HNA endorsements have mostly been successful.","tags":null,"title":"Workforce Outcomes of Program Completers in High Needs Areas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emanuele Bardelli","Matthew Ronfeldt"],"categories":null,"content":"In this talk, I will discuss the results of the mentors matter recruitment initiative—a field experiment within a teacher preparation program that had the goal of improving student teacher experiences by recruiting mentor teachers using evaluation data.

The analysis of open-ended responses to those scenarios by hand, however, is time- consuming and achieving interrater reliability for linguistics-informed coding is challenging. Using open-ended responses from a national sample of teachers, we first develop a custom word embedding, representative of teacher discussions of classroom events. A word embedding is a mapping of the set of words into a continuous (and fairly low-dimensional) vector space, where ‘semantically-similar’ words are mapped to nearby points. While other popular pre-trained word embeddings exist (e.g., Word2Vec and Glove), our custom model optimizes the embeddings in a way that is sensitive to the subject-specificity of classroom situations. We then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify teachers’ responses based on their appraisal of classroom practice. Using Cohen’s Kappa, we find high inter-rater reliability (k=0.9) between the computer model and human coders, which shows promise that machine learning methods can improve and enhance our current understanding of and research on teaching.","tags":["Practical Rationality","Machine Learning"],"title":"Learning about the norms of teaching practice: How can machine learning help analyze teachers’ reactions to scenarios?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emanuele Bardelli","Matthew Ronfeldt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531236600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582488894,"objectID":"63d22582438b400c624ac3403a40a79c","permalink":"//bardelli.me/2018/07/ct-effects/","publishdate":"2018-07-09T12:18:05-04:00","relpermalink":"/2018/07/ct-effects/","section":"talk","summary":"Pre-service clinical experiences, like student teaching, remain one of the most effective ways to train teacher candidates.

However, there is some concern that agreeing to be a CT could negatively impact a teacher’s evaluations and student test scores. We examine whether the concerns about serving as a CT are warranted. Specifically, we share the results of a quasi-experimental analysis of the effects of serving as a CT on evaluation metrics. We found that teachers’ observation rating increase and that value-added scores do not change in years that teachers serve as CTs.","tags":["CIERS","2018"],"title":"Effects of serving as a cooperating teacher on evaluation metrics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Matthew Ronfeldt","Dan Goldhaber","James Cowan","Emanuele Bardelli","Joy Johnson","Christopher Daniel Tien"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587572709,"objectID":"0712db645a0c5ec5d7418c3c5e49d1e0","permalink":"//bardelli.me/publication/ronfeldt-2018-a/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T16:24:38.652825Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ronfeldt-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Identifying Promising Clinical Placements Using Administrative Data: Preliminary Results from ISTI Placement Initiative Pilot","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1521923474,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542570013,"objectID":"6b824e2b1170ffd1861038b597b894c2","permalink":"//bardelli.me/project/ies-predoc/","publishdate":"2018-03-24T16:31:14-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/ies-predoc/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["IES","PreDoc"],"title":"Institute for Educational Sciences Pre-Doctoral Fellowship","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"GRIP (Geometry, Reasoning, and Instructional Practices) is a research group in the School of Education at the University of Michigan.
