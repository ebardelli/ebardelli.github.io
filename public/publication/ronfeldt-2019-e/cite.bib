 abstract = {Prior work suggests that recent graduates from teacher education programs
feel better prepared to teach and are more instructionally effective when
they learned to teach with more instructionally effective cooperating
teachers. However, we do not know if these relationships are causal. Even
if they are, we do not know if it is possible to recruit cooperating
teachers who are, on average, significantly more effective than those
currently serving. This paper describes an innovative strategy to use
historical administrative on teachers to recommend the most
instructionally effective teachers in various districts and subject areas
to serve as cooperating teachers. In collaboration with a large teacher
education program, partnering districts were randomized to receive either
recommendation lists or use business-as-usual approaches. Those districts
that received recommendations recruited significantly and meaningfully
more effective and experienced cooperating teachers. Additionally,
preservice student teachers who learned to teach in these same districts
felt significantly better prepared to teach. This study offers an
innovative and low-cost strategy for recruiting effective and experienced
cooperating teachers and presents some of the first evidence that learning
to teach with instructionally effective cooperating teachers has a causal
impact on feelings of preparedness to teach.},
