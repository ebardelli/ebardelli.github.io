 abstract = {For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages in high-needs areas (HNAs), including science, mathematics, and special education, as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit HNA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee, we observe that the number of teachers who receive HNA endorsements has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNA teachers have similar student achievement gains as non-HNA teachers. Though HNA and non-HNA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM and special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Overall, findings suggest that efforts in Tennessee to recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with HNA endorsements have mostly been successful.},
