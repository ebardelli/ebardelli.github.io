 abstract = {For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages in high-needs endorsement areas (HNEAs), including science, mathematics, and special education, as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit HNEA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee, we observe that the number of teachers who receive HNEA endorsements has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNEA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNEA teachers have similar student achievement gains as nonHNEA teachers. Though HNEA and non-HNEA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM and special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Overall, we offer suggestive evidence that efforts in Tennessee to recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with HNEA endorsements have mostly been successful.},
