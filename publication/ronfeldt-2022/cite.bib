 abstract = {Despite their critical role in the preparation of pre-service teachers, very little research has explored the impacts of offering mentors professional development around how to coach and support their candidates. We conduct  an evaluation of a professional development opportunity offered by the state of Tennessee to randomly assigned mentors at six different programs over the course of three years, investigating its impacts on the perceptions and practices of both the mentors themselves and their candidates. We find t hat professional development increases mentors' frequency of coaching and mentors' own instructional effectiveness, particularly in emphasized areas, as well as candidates' employment rates, highlighting the potential of mentor professional development to improve the clinical placement experience as a whole.},
