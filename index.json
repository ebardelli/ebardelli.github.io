Consistent with national trends, between 2010-11 and 2015-16, State has experienced substantial statewide declines in educator preparation program (EPP) enrollment (48 percent) and completion (32 percent). During this time, State has also consistently reported teacher shortages in certain high-needs subject areas (e.g., STEM, special education, English as a second language) and schools (e.g., low-income, rural). During this time, the state has seen a steeper decline among students of color enrolling and completing (about 3% percent) preparation programs. Given growing evidence for academic and non-academic benefits of having teachers of color for all students, and especially students of color, understanding where in the pipeline we are losing potential teachers of color is especially critical.\nWhile the state has implemented a number of policies and practices to offset teacher shortages, national trends suggest that State needs to continue to be proactive about assessing and addressing current and future shortages. In this paper, we report on longitudinal trends over the past 15 years, when enrollments in EPPs have declined, to examine whether or not there have been changes in the kinds of individuals going through the State’s P-20 system, entering EPPs, and becoming teachers. Though we consider trends across all teachers, we focus particularly on students of color.\nWe use data from State Higher Education Commission from public institutions in the state covering roughly 2 million students over the past 15 years. These data include semester enrollment data (e.g., declared major and gpa), degree data for associate, bachelor, and master degrees, admission information (e.g., high school GPA, ACT/SAT scores), student demographic information. We merge these data to the State teacher longitudinal data set, including licensing and employment records for teachers employed in State public schools.\nFrom these data, we model the pipeline into teaching that college students follow using structural equation modeling. We conceptualize the pipeline into a series of steps that we can identify in our data. These include declaring a major that potentially could lead to teaching, receiving an associates’ degree, receiving a bachelors’ degree, becoming licensed a licensed teacher, and being reported as a teacher in a public school. We add two optional pathways to this pipeline, including receiving a master’s degree and completing a teacher preparation program in the state. While prior work has examined different aspects of the teacher pipeline, ours is unique in being able to examine so many stages simultaneously such that we can consider declines at each stage relative to others. In this way, we can determine which stages are especially leaky. We can also test whether the stages in which we are losing prospective teachers of color are similar to the stages where we are losing most white teachers.\nWe find that our SEM model is a good fit to our data and that White and Black teachers follow somewhat different pathways to teaching. We find that Black teachers are more likely to leave the pipeline early as they are more likely not to continue even if they received an AA in a teaching field, more likely to not complete a BA in a teaching major even after declaring a major in a teaching field, or continue through to a teaching preparation program after receiving a BA. On the other hand, we find that Black students are more persistent in the pipeline once they enter a teaching preparation program and receive a license.\nOur results have the potential to inform current and future recruitment practices for Black teachers, pointing towards the need to strengthen the recruitment and retention of Black teachers early in their college careers.\n","date":1648397700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648397700,"objectID":"ce61981a8ba0b0be2ef68904598b50ee","permalink":"/talk/teacher-pipeline-appam-21/","publishdate":"2021-08-07T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/teacher-pipeline-appam-21/","section":"event","summary":"As the number of people enrolling in teacher certification programs have steadily declined across the United States, many are now predicting a teacher shortage crisis nationwide.

Other research found that the characteristics of field placement schools (FPSs) where PSTs complete their clinical preparation are related to PSTs’ performance; PSTs perform better when their employment schools more closely match their FPSs. Our work grew out of a community-university partnership between our team and a state department of education with the goal of improving teacher preparation outcomes in the state. To do this, we replicate prior work examining the relationship between the general instructional effectiveness of PSTs and CMs with an extension to most programs in the state and consider specific domains of the teacher evaluation rubric. We examine heterogeneity in the relationship between CM and PST instructional effectiveness across various dimensions of FPSs (e.g. school size, grades served). Consistent with prior work, PST ORs are positively associated with CM ORs (b=0.037, p\u0026lt;0.001); however, they are negatively correlated with CM VAMs (b=-0.045, p\u0026lt;0.05). PST VAMs are positively correlated with CM VAMs (b=0.051, p\u0026lt;0.01). PST VAMs are not significantly related to CM ORs, however there is a positive trend.\nWe also find that PST effectiveness in specific teaching domains tends to be correlated with their CM’s effectiveness in the same domains, suggesting that the relationship between CM and PST instructional effectiveness may be causal. There is a significant positive correlation between PST and CM ratings in the instruction (b=0.035, p\u0026lt;0.01) and planning domains (b=0.039, p\u0026lt;0.001). Heterogeneity by FPS characteristic analyses are ongoing.

In large-scale observational studies of recent graduates in Tennessee and Washington state (Goldhaber, Krieg, \u0026amp; Theobald, 2020; Ronfeldt, Brockman, \u0026amp; Campbell, 2018), researchers found that PSTs who were placed with more instructionally effective CTs were more instructionally effective themselves.The correlational nature of these studies, though, raised questions about whether these relationships were truly causal or just spurious correlations due to outside factors.\nAddressing concerns over causality, recent randomized control trials have found positive effects of being placed with a more instructionally effective mentor on self-reported survey outcomes collected at the end of the student teaching experience. Ronfeldt, Goldhaber, Cowan, et al. (2018) found that student teachers assigned to more instructionally effective mentors reported receiving significantly more frequent and better coaching, as well as more opportunities to practice various instructional strategies. However, they found nonsignificant, though trending positive, differences between the treatment and control groups on feelings of preparedness to teach.\nBy contrast, the Mentors Matter Recruitment (MMR) initiative - the focus of this proposal - found positive effects on PSTs feelings of preparedness to teach (Ronfeldt, Bardelli, Mullman, et al., 2019). Partnering with one large program, Ronfeldt and colleagues used prior teacher evaluation information to identify the most instructionally effective teachers and sent recommendation lists to randomly selected partner districts to target their CT recruitment. Districts that received these lists recruited substantially more effective CTs and their candidate felt significantly better prepared. This paper discusses the replication efforts for the MMR initiative.\nThe first replication study fully replicates the results for the MMR initiative. Districts that were randomized to receive the recruitment lists were able to recruit significantly and meaningfully more instructionally effective and experienced CTs. As before, PSTs assigned to these CTs reported feeling better prepared at the end of their clinical experiences. Finally, PSTs still reported no significant differences in the kind of, frequency of, and satisfaction with the coaching they experienced.\nThe second replication study finds that the recruitment lists can be implemented on a large scale beyond the initial teacher preparation program that participated in the first RCTs. Participating teacher education programs were able to use the recruitment lists without major modifications to recruit the needed mentor cohort. Analysis of the effects on mentor quality and student teacher outcomes is underway.\nTwo major findings emerge from these replications studies. First, we were able to replicate the positive findings on mentor quality and student teacher feelings of preparation when implementing the MMR initiative a second time. This provides confirmatory evidence that the MMR initiative’s positive results were not a one-off result but rather a robust finding that can inform teacher education policy and practice. Second, the re-implementation with multiple teacher education programs provide initial evidence that this intervention can work at scale to inform the selection and recruitment of effective teachers to serve as clinical mentors.\n","date":1617980400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617980400,"objectID":"1b9e34370fec476296bcbffe9a811cf1","permalink":"/talk/mentoring-panel/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mentoring-panel/","section":"event","summary":"Emerging research in teacher education is showing that cooperating teachers (CTs) have a substantial impact on preservice student teachers’ (PSTs’) future teaching trajectories.

There is increasing evidence that clinical training generally, and CMs specifically, have important influences on preservice student teacher (PST) development. Three new studies show that teacher candidates who were mentored by instructionally effective teachers are more instructionally effective themselves once employed, suggesting that teacher education programs and district/school leaders should recruit more instructionally effective teachers to serve as CMs. However, program leaders report that it is often difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as mentors for a variety of reasons, including: (1) school and district leaders may be resistant to hand responsibility of instruction to novice teachers in the classrooms of their strongest teachers and (2) school, district and program leaders may not know who their most instructionally effective teachers are or, (3) different stakeholders sometimes have competing criteria for selecting mentors.\nIn the Mentors Matter: Recruitment Initiative, we used prior information on instructional performance and years of experience (from administrative data) to identify the most instructionally effective and experienced potential CMs in the specific districts, subjects and grade levels needed by a large program that partnered with us. We then randomly assigned neighboring districts to receive these targeted recruitment lists (or not) to test whether receiving these lists (1) increases the instructional quality of the CMs that are actually recruited and (2) improves feelings of preparedness, based upon data collected from online surveys completed by PSTs at the end of their clinical training.\nWe find that CMs in treatment districts have, on average, substantially higher evaluation scores than CMs in control districts.

The analysis of open-ended responses to those scenarios by hand, however, is time- consuming and achieving interrater reliability for linguistics-informed coding is challenging. Using open-ended responses from a national sample of teachers, we first develop a custom word embedding, representative of teacher discussions of classroom events. A word embedding is a mapping of the set of words into a continuous (and fairly low-dimensional) vector space, where ‘semantically-similar’ words are mapped to nearby points. While other popular pre-trained word embeddings exist (e.g., Word2Vec and Glove), our custom model optimizes the embeddings in a way that is sensitive to the subject-specificity of classroom situations. We then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify teachers’ responses based on their appraisal of classroom practice. Using Cohen’s Kappa, we find high inter-rater reliability (k=0.9) between the computer model and human coders, which shows promise that machine learning methods can improve and enhance our current understanding of and research on teaching.","tags":["Practical Rationality","Machine Learning"],"title":"Learning about the norms of teaching practice: How can machine learning help analyze teachers’ reactions to scenarios?","type":"event"},{"authors":["Emanuele Bardelli","Matthew Ronfeldt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531236600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531236600,"objectID":"2ae6acdab06764b456b7a2dcd13331c3","permalink":"/talk/ct-effects/","publishdate":"2018-07-09T12:18:05-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ct-effects/","section":"event","summary":"Pre-service clinical experiences, like student teaching, remain one of the most effective ways to train teacher candidates.
