In this study, we seek to contribute to this growing literature by investigating the potential bias in teacher evaluation systems against teachers with minoritized racial and ethnic as well as gender identities. Employing data from the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) data, we propose to use item response theory (IRT) to assess whether teachers of different identities but comparable teaching expertise receive systematically biased observation ratings on specific items across the continuum of instructional effectiveness. Given the use of these measures in high-stakes decisions around educators’ careers, the repercussions of structural bias in teacher evaluations not only are of direct harm to teachers (and students) of marginalized identities but also reinforce the dominant cultural hegemony in our educational system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring the Relationship Between Teacher Growth Trajectories and Teacher Preparation Program Features</title><link>/event/epp-growth-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 10:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/event/epp-growth-features/</guid><description>&lt;p>Research has found variation across teacher preparation programs (TPPs) in graduates’
workforce outcomes. Less is known, though, about the specific features of preparation that
explain program variation in outcomes. We explore how specific TPP features correlate with
graduates’ initial performance and improvement during their early careers. We use program
completer data from one state and link it to teacher evaluation data and USDoE Title 2 data. We
find variation in both initial performance and improvement along different TPP features,
including areas of endorsement, program type, clinical placement type and length, program size
and faculty composition. Our results have the potential to inform how TPP features relate to
graduates’ outcomes and levers for TPP improvement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replicating and Extending the Mentors Matter Recruitment Initiative Findings</title><link>/event/mentoring-panel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 10:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/event/mentoring-panel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Emerging research in teacher education is showing that cooperating teachers (CTs) have a substantial impact on preservice student teachers’ (PSTs’) future teaching trajectories. In large-scale observational studies of recent graduates in Tennessee and Washington state (Goldhaber, Krieg, &amp;amp; Theobald, 2020; Ronfeldt, Brockman, &amp;amp; Campbell, 2018), researchers found that PSTs who were placed with more instructionally effective CTs were more instructionally effective themselves.The correlational nature of these studies, though, raised questions about whether these relationships were truly causal or just spurious correlations due to outside factors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing concerns over causality, recent randomized control trials have found positive effects of being placed with a more instructionally effective mentor on self-reported survey outcomes collected at the end of the student teaching experience. Ronfeldt, Goldhaber, Cowan, et al. (2018) found that student teachers assigned to more instructionally effective mentors reported receiving significantly more frequent and better coaching, as well as more opportunities to practice various instructional strategies. However, they found nonsignificant, though trending positive, differences between the treatment and control groups on feelings of preparedness to teach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By contrast, the Mentors Matter Recruitment (MMR) initiative - the focus of this proposal - found positive effects on PSTs feelings of preparedness to teach (Ronfeldt, Bardelli, Mullman, et al., 2019). Partnering with one large program, Ronfeldt and colleagues used prior teacher evaluation information to identify the most instructionally effective teachers and sent recommendation lists to randomly selected partner districts to target their CT recruitment. Districts that received these lists recruited substantially more effective CTs and their candidate felt significantly better prepared. This paper discusses the replication efforts for the MMR initiative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first replication study fully replicates the results for the MMR initiative. Districts that were randomized to receive the recruitment lists were able to recruit significantly and meaningfully more instructionally effective and experienced CTs. As before, PSTs assigned to these CTs reported feeling better prepared at the end of their clinical experiences. Finally, PSTs still reported no significant differences in the kind of, frequency of, and satisfaction with the coaching they experienced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second replication study finds that the recruitment lists can be implemented on a large scale beyond the initial teacher preparation program that participated in the first RCTs. Participating teacher education programs were able to use the recruitment lists without major modifications to recruit the needed mentor cohort. Analysis of the effects on mentor quality and student teacher outcomes is underway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two major findings emerge from these replications studies. First, we were able to replicate the positive findings on mentor quality and student teacher feelings of preparation when implementing the MMR initiative a second time. This provides confirmatory evidence that the MMR initiative’s positive results were not a one-off result but rather a robust finding that can inform teacher education policy and practice. Second, the re-implementation with multiple teacher education programs provide initial evidence that this intervention can work at scale to inform the selection and recruitment of effective teachers to serve as clinical mentors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Effects of using administrative data to guide the recruitment of instructionally effective &amp; experienced clinical mentors: Results from a randomized control trial</title><link>/event/appam20/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 11:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/event/appam20/</guid><description>&lt;p>In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete clinical training, often referred to as “student teaching” or “residency,” in the classroom of a clinical mentor (CM) – a P-12 teacher who mentors them as they take on classroom teaching responsibilities. There is increasing evidence that clinical training generally, and CMs specifically, have important influences on preservice student teacher (PST) development. Three new studies show that teacher candidates who were mentored by instructionally effective teachers are more instructionally effective themselves once employed, suggesting that teacher education programs and district/school leaders should recruit more instructionally effective teachers to serve as CMs. However, program leaders report that it is often difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as mentors for a variety of reasons, including: (1) school and district leaders may be resistant to hand responsibility of instruction to novice teachers in the classrooms of their strongest teachers and (2) school, district and program leaders may not know who their most instructionally effective teachers are or, (3) different stakeholders sometimes have competing criteria for selecting mentors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Mentors Matter: Recruitment Initiative, we used prior information on instructional performance and years of experience (from administrative data) to identify the most instructionally effective and experienced potential CMs in the specific districts, subjects and grade levels needed by a large program that partnered with us. We then randomly assigned neighboring districts to receive these targeted recruitment lists (or not) to test whether receiving these lists (1) increases the instructional quality of the CMs that are actually recruited and (2) improves feelings of preparedness, based upon data collected from online surveys completed by PSTs at the end of their clinical training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We find that CMs in treatment districts have, on average, substantially higher evaluation scores than CMs in control districts. These differences are significant on observation ratings (0.332 s.d. units), TVAAS scores (0.654 s.d. units), and years of experience (0.558 s.d. units).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, at the end of clinical training, PSTs in treatment districts reported feeling significantly better prepared on both questioning practices (0.660 standard deviation units) and other instructional skills (0.576 standard deviation units). On the other hand, PSTs in treatment and control districts reported statistically similar rates of mentoring and coaching activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These results suggest that the recruitment of CMs is a feasible and effective lever to improve teacher education. As our intervention uses evaluation and personnel data that is readily available at the district and state level, using prior information to aid the recruitment of CMs is a low-cost intervention that can significantly impact the overall instructional quality of CMs, as well as their PSTs’ readiness to teach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development of the Short Critical Consciousness Scale (ShoCCS)</title><link>/publication/diemer-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/diemer-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Improving Preservice Teachers’ Feelings of Preparedness to Teach through Recruitment of Instructionally Effective and Experienced Cooperating Teachers: A Randomized Experiment</title><link>/publication/ronfeldt-2020-a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/ronfeldt-2020-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Early Career Supports and their Relation to Teacher Effectiveness and Employment Outcomes</title><link>/event/early-career-ciers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/event/early-career-ciers/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://umich.zoom.us/j/92668858766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to talk&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Room for Improvement?

&lt;p>While mathematics content courses are expected to provide future teachers with
the needed content knowledge to become an effective educator, little is known
about the effects of these courses on content knowledge development. In this
paper, we report on the outcomes for 222 students from 13 Geometry for
Teachers courses taken across the United States. We find that completing this
course is positively associated with a growth in MKT-G scores similar to the
growth in MKT-G scores that we would expect between the first and second year
of experience teaching geometry. We also observe that these positive results
are concentrated with course completers who are interested in pursuing a
secondary mathematics teacher certification.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning from the Best: Promising Practices in Preparing Tennessee's Future Teachers</title><link>/publication/morris-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/morris-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Workforce Outcomes of Program Completers in High Needs Areas</title><link>/working-paper/bardelli-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/working-paper/bardelli-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mentors Matter Recruitment initiative: Can mentor teacher recruitment increase student teacher feelings of preparedness?</title><link>/event/mmr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/event/mmr/</guid><description>&lt;p>In order to receive initial teacher certification, teacher candidates complete
